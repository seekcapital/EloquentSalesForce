## Overview

Eloquent SalesForce, now known as ElSF /else-if/, is a package that allows you to interact with SalesForce objects in the same way you would interact with an Eloquent model in your local application. Simplifying the process of writing applications that leverage SalesForce APIs and data.

## Updating

> Important notes for updating to 2.13
>
> * the `protected $dates` array is now monitored appropriately
> * All custom or additional date fields must be listed in this array. That means if it is overridden, you must include the `LastModifiedDate` and `CreatedDate` columns. This will ensure that dates are formatted as Carbon objects, and also that they are properly formatted in the queries being sent to SalesForce.
> * The `push()` method on a SoqlBatch no longer conflicts with older versions of Laravel, but it also should not be used for batching. Instead, use `query()`.

# Getting Started

## Installation

Install via composer

```bash
composer require rob-lester-jr04/eloquent-sales-force
```

> Note: This package is only tested and supported Laravel 6.0 and up.

## Setting up your connected app

1. Log into to your Salesforce org
2. Click on Setup in the upper right-hand menu
3. Under Build click `Create > Apps`
4. Scroll to the bottom and click `New` under Connected Apps.
5. Enter the following details for the remote application:
	* Connected App Name
	* API Name
	* Contact Email
	* Enable OAuth Settings under the API dropdown
	* Callback URL
	* Select access scope (If you need a refresh token, specify it here)
6. Click `Save`

After saving, you will now be given a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. Update your config file with values for `consumerKey`, `consumerSecret`, and `loginURL`.

## Configuration

In your `config/database.php` file, add the following driver to the connections array

```php
'soql' => [
	'driver' => 'soql',
	'database' => null,
	'consumerKey'    => env('SF_CONSUMER_KEY'),
	'consumerSecret' => env('SF_CONSUMER_SECRET'),
	'loginURL'       => env('SF_LOGIN_URL'),
	// Only required for UserPassword authentication:
	'username'       => env('SF_USERNAME'),
	// Security token might need to be ammended to password unless IP Address is whitelisted
	'password'       => env('SF_PASSWORD')
],
```

If you need to modify any more settings for Forrest, publish the config file using the `artisan` command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish
```

You can find the config file in: `config/eloquent_sf.php`. Any of the same settings that Forrest recognizes will be available to set here.

## Model Setup

Create a model for the object you want to use, example:

```bash
artisan make:model Lead
```

Open the model file, it will look like this:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Lead extends Model
{
	//
}
```

Replace the `use` statement so your model looks like:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Lester\EloquentSalesForce\Model;

class Lead extends Model
{
	//
}
```

You can also use the new artisan command:

```bash
artisan make:salesforce Lead
```

This will generate the model as you see above without any changes necessary

# The Basics

ElSF was designed so even a junior Laravel developer could interact with SalesForce with ease and familiarity. One of the best features of Laravel is the Eloquent ORM. It is so easy to work with and to scale upon. Why can't interacting with a third party system be just as easy. Define your model as shown above, and begin treating it like a normal local eloquent model.

## Queries

```php
$leads = Lead::where('Email', 'user@test.com')->get();

$lead = Lead::find('00Q1J00000cQ08eUAC');

$email = $lead->Email;
```

## Insert

```php
$lead = new Lead();
$lead->FirstName = 'Foo';
$lead->LastName = 'Bar';
$lead->Company = 'Test';
$lead->save();
```

OR:

```php
$lead = Lead::create([
	'FirstName' => 'Foo',
	'LastName' => 'Bar',
	'Company' => 'Test Company'
]);
```

## Update

```php
$lead = Lead::first();
$lead->LastName = 'Lester';
$lead->save();
```

OR:

```php
$lead->update([
	'LastName' => 'Lester'
]);
```

## Delete

```php
$lead = Lead::first();

$lead->delete();
```

# Advanced Usage

Many of the familiar advanced capabilities of Eloquent objects are available on the Eloquent SF Objects as well.

## Observers

Eloquent SF Objects support the standard use of [Observers](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent#observers) supported in Laravel. The following example is a static observer on the model, added in the `booted()` method.

```php
/* Lead Model */
public static function booted()
{
	// Example setting the phone number when creating the model.
	static::creating(function ($lead) {
		$lead->Phone = '1231231234';
	});
}
```

## Soft Deletes

SalesForce already handles soft-deleting natively on every object. ElSF expose the traditional soft-delete methods that Eloquent has to query upon trashed elements.

```php

/* Finding deleted items */
Lead::withTrashed()->where('Email', 'email@test.com')->get();

/* Checking if an item is deleted */
$lead->trashed()

/* Quering only deleted items */
Lead::onlyTrashed()->get();

```

## Columns

By default, the selected columns for the record will be the compact layout defined in the SalesForce instance. This is usually enough. If you need to pull specific columns, you have some options.

```php
// Per select
$object = Contact::select('Id', 'Name')->get();
```

You can also define on the model what columns you want to bring back with each record. Add `public $columns` to the top of the model.

```php
...

	public $columns = [
		'Name',
		'Id',
		'Email',
	];
```

To return the columns currently available on a model, use the `describe` method on the object.

```php
$fields = Lead::describe();
```

## Dates

In Laravel, there are 2 very important date fields; `created_at` and `updated_at`. SalesForce models have the same, but the names are different. They are `CreatedDate` and `LastModifiedDate`, respectively.

> There is no (native) equivalent to `deleted_at`.

```php

Lead::where('CreatedDate', '>=', today())->get();

Lead::insert([
  ...
  'Custom_Date_Field__c' => now()
]);

```

The abstract model declares `$dates` appropriately so that they are casted and queried correctly. If you have custom date columns you want to query on in this model, it is strongly recommended that you override this array and add those date fields. This is how ElSF knows what fields are dates and what fields are not, and SalesForce can be picky about how dates are passed in the queries.

```php
...

  protected $dates = [
    'CreatedDate',
    'LastModifiedDate',
  ];

```

```php
...

  protected $dates = [
    'CreatedDate',
    'LastModifiedDate',
    'Form_Fill_Date__c', // Our custom date field we want handled as a date
  ];

```

When you're working with `Date` types in SalesForce, instead of `DateTime` types, query your  model with `whereDate()` instead of `where()` - This will format your date values correctly when passing to SalesForce. This is required if working with a field in SalesForce that is expecting a short-date, ie `2010-01-01`.

```php
...
  Lead::whereDate('Custom_Date_Field__c', '>', today())->get();

```

As SalesForce does not have a type of only `Time`, the native Laravel `whereTime()` query method will alias `where()` and query SalesForce as `DateTime`.

## Where / Order By
The `where` and `orderBy` methods work as usual as well.

```php
$contacts = Contact::where('Email', 'test@test.com')->first();

$contacts = Contact::where('Name', 'like', 'Donuts%')->get();

$contacts = Contact::limit(20)->orderBy('Name')->get();
```

## Relationships

Relationships work the same way.

Create a model like above for `Account` and `Contact`

In the `Contact` model, add a method for a relationship like you normally would

```php
## Contact.php
public function account()
{
	return $this->belongsTo(Account::class);
}
```

So you can call now:

```php
$contact = Contact::where('email', 'some@email.com')->first();
$account = $contact->account;
```

And the reverse is true

```php
## Account.php
public function contacts()
{
	return $this->hasMany(Contact::class);
}
```

```php
$contacts = $account->contacts;
```

You are also able to use manual joins

```php
$account = Account::join('Contact', 'AccountId')->first();
```

These aren't as easy to work with as **Relationships** because the SalesForce API still returns the array nested in the `records` property.

## ReadOnly Fields

To specify fields on the model that are read-only and to force them to be excluded from any update/insert requests, define the `protected $readonly = []` array in the model

```php
...

	protected $readonly = [
		'Name'
	];
```

## Picklists

If you are using a field that is a picklist in SalesForce, you can capture the values of that picklist from this function on the model.

```php

$statusValues = $lead->getPicklistValues('Status');

// This is just a shortcut to the below...
```

```php
// Provide a salesforce object name, IE Lead

$statusValue = SObjects::getPicklistValues('Lead', 'Status');
```

## Local Sync (NEW!)

A new trait has been created to make it simple to keep a local DB model in sync with a salesforce object.

Use this if you want to keep a local table, or just some fields, in sync with an SF object. Instead of working directly with SF objects, you can manage a local table as you may be more familiar with, and just keep some data in sync with SalesForce.

```php
<?php

namespace Lester\EloquentSalesForce;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Lester\EloquentSalesForce\Traits\SyncsWithSalesforce;

class SalesLead extends Model
{
	use SyncsWithSalesforce;

	protected $salesForceObject = 'Lead'; // Required unless your classname matches the SF object name.

	protected $fillable = [ // Typical field def for local db model
		'email',
		'firstName',
		'lastName',
		'company',
		'source',
		'type',
	];

	protected $salesForceFieldMap = [ // Mapping of the SF fields to local fields
		'Email' => 'email',
		'FirstName' => 'firstName',
		'LastName' => 'lastName',
		'Company' => 'company',
	];
}
```

If you need to perform more complex data manipulation when syncing, just use mutators on your local model and map the SF fields to the mutated fields. Here's an example.

```php
  protected $salesForceFieldMap = [ // Mapping of the SF fields to local fields
    'Email' => 'email',
    'FirstName' => 'first_name',
    'LastName' => 'last_name',
    'Company' => 'company',
  ];

  public function getFirstNameAttribute()
  {
    return Str::before($this->name, ' ');
  }

  public function getLastNameAttribute()
  {
    return Str::after($this->name, ' ');
  }

  public function setFirstNameAttribute($value)
  {
    $nameParts = explode(' ', $this->attributes['name']);
    $nameParts[0] = $value;
    $this->attributes['name'] = implode(' ', $nameParts);
  }

  public function setLastNameAttribute($value)
  {
    $nameParts = explode(' ', $this->attributes['name']);
    $nameParts[1] = $value;
    $this->attributes['name'] = implode(' ', $nameParts);
  }
```

## Custom Objects

To use custom objects (or an object with a special object name, different from the model), set the protected `$table` property in the model.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Lester\EloquentSalesForce\Model;

class TouchPoint extends Model
{
	protected $table = 'TouchPoint__c';

	/** Any other overrides **/
}
```

# Bulk Operations

## Batch Queries

SalesForce has API limits. We know this. It sucks. For us at least. So now in the package, you can batch several queries and make a single API call to execute them, and get the results back in a handy collection object.

At the end of most queries we commonly call `get()` to retrieve the results of our assembled query. We can queue up a batch call by calling `batch()` instead of `get()`. After queuing up the desired queries, you can call `SObjects::runBatch()` and it will return the results of the batched queries in an array.

```php
Lead::select(['Id', 'FirstName', 'Company'])->limit(100)->batch(); // instead of get.

Contact::select(['Id', 'FirstName', 'Phone'])->limit(50)->batch();

$batch = SObjects::runBatch();

$leads = $batch->results('Lead_0'); // get() also works here...
$contacts = $batch->results('Contact_1'); // ... and here.
```

By default, each batch query is tagged with the name of the model that is being queried with the array index appended after an underscore. For example if you batch a query for the model class called `Prospects` (even if it maps to the SF Lead object), and its the first batched query, the tag of the batch will be `Prospects_0`. To reduce confusion, we recommend tagging the batch when you queue it if you're batching multiple queries on the same object.

```php
Lead::select(['Id', 'FirstName', 'Company'])->limit(100)->batch(); // Will be tagged as Lead_0

Lead::select(['Id', 'FirstName', 'Company'])->limit(30)->where('Company', 'Test')->batch('test_company');

$batch = SObjects::runBatch();

$firstCentLeads = $batch->get('Lead_0');
$testCompanyLeads = $batch->get('test_company');

```

## Batch Collection Object

The batch collection object can be used independently of the facade if you'd like to create a batch over time and then execute later. When using the `batch()` method on the query builder, the assembled query builder is added to a collection on the facade. You can either run that batch collection by using the method `SObjects::runBatch()` or you can access the collection by returning `SObjects::getBatch()`. If you have the object stored in a variable, you can run it with `->run()` or you can add more query builders to it with `->batch`

```php
$batchCollection = new SOQLBatch();

$batchCollection->batch(Lead::where('FirstName', 'like', 'Test%'));

$batchCollection->run();

```

## Bulk Insert

```php
$leads = collect([
	new Lead(['Email' => 'email1@test.com']),
	new Lead(['Email' => 'email2@test.com'])
]);

Lead::insert($leads);
```

## Bulk Update

The bulk update method is model agnostic - meaning that this capability, within salesforce, accepts a mix of object types in the collection that gets sent. So this method therefore exists in the new SObjects facade.

```php
$accounts = Account::where('Company', 'Test Company')->get(); // collection of accounts.

$accounts = $accounts->map(function($account) {
	$account->Company = 'New Company Name';
	return $account;
});

SObjects::update($accounts); // Sends all these objects to SF with updates.
```

SalesForce will execute each update individually and will not fail the batch if any individual update fails. If you want success to be dependent on all updates succeeding (all or nothing), then you can pass `true` as the second parameter. If this is set, the batch of updates must all succeed, or none will.

```php
SObjects::update($accounts, true); // All or none.
```

## Bulk Delete

Run it on a query if you need to...

```php
Lead::where('Email', 'like', '%@test.com')->delete();

// Lets go nuclear!!!!
Lead::truncate();
```

# The SObjects Facade
This is a new feature to the package. The SObjects facade serves the purpose of exposing any global features not model specific, such as authentication and mass updates, but also it is a pass-thru mechanism for the Forrest facade.

Any methods such as get, post, patch, resources, etc will pass through to the Forrest facade and accept parameters respectively.

## Authentication
The `authenticate()` method in the facade will return the token information that has been stored in cache/session.

## Anonymous Objects
Sometimes you want to grab a record from SalesForce casually without having to pre-generate a model for it. Now you can do that easily with the `object` method on the facade. Example:

```php
$queryResult = SObjects::query("Select Id, FirstName from Lead where Email like 'test@%'");

$leads = collect($queryResult['records'])->map(function($record) {
	return SObjects::object($record);
});

```

The class used for each object returned will be `Lester\EloquentSalesForce\SalesForceObject`.

You can also query directly against the object like so:

```php

$leads = SalesForceObject::select('Email', 'Id')->from('Lead')->get();

```

## Pick list choices
You can get the possible pick list values from a dropdown by using this method on the facade.

```php
$listValues = SObjects::getPicklistValues('Lead', 'Status');
```

## Logging
You can set a different log channel for the SOQL actions by specifying `SOQL_LOG=` in your `.env` file.

# Testing

The tests in this package are meant for contributors and have been written to be executed independently of a Laravel application. They will not work as part of the applications testing flow.

Create a `.env` file that includes the SalesForce credentials for your test instance, or else the test will fail to execute. The `.env` field should include these properties:

```txt
USERNAME=
PASSWORD=
CONSUMER_KEY=
CONSUMER_SECRET=
LOGIN_URL=https://login.salesforce.com
CACHE_DRIVER=array
LOG_CHANNEL=file
```

Dependencies are required, so execute `composer install`

To execute, run `composer test`
